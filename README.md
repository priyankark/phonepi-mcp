# PhonePi MCP: Turn your phone into a toolbox for AI assistants using Model Context Protocol

A powerful MCP server and companion app that allows you to manage and control your phone remotely using natural language commands via your favorite MCP-supported AI apps such as Cursor and Claude Desktop. This project provides a comprehensive set of tools and APIs to interact with your mobile device programmatically.

## Overview

Phone MCP enables you to:
- Manage contacts and messages
- Handle snippets and notes
- Control phone settings and notifications
- Send SMS and make calls
- Share content across apps
- Monitor battery status
- Set timers and reminders
- Find your phone with audio alerts

## Security
Security is a high concern. Here are a few aspects taken into account around security:
- You are completely in charge around hosting the MCP server locally. The code is completely open source.
- On the app front, you are in charge of what permissions to give depending on the features you want to use.
- The app and the server are linked over your local network. There's no 3p remote servers involved in linking.
- It is highly recommended you use this app over a secure network. Avoid public networks like airports and restaurants.
- Tailscale is highly recommended for creating a private & secure VPN to connect your phone and desktops
