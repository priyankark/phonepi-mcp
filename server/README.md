# PhonePi MCP

A MCP server that lets you control your phone from your favorite AI apps!

## Prerequisites
You need to setup the PhonePi MCP app on your phone. Please visit [PhonePi MCP](https://phonepimcp.com) for instructions.

# MCP Server Setup
Simply follow the steps below to setup the server in your favorite AI apps such as Claude, Cline or Cursor.

## Installation

Install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g phonepi-mcp
```

Or run directly with npx:

```bash
npx phonepi-mcp
```

## Setup
Simply add the following MCP config to your AI app:
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "phonepi-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "phonepi-mcp",
        "start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Save the file with the above settings. This is all you need for your setup besides the mobile app.

## Connecting
* Ensure your phone and your desktop are on the same network. Using something like Tailscale is recommended for convenience, but it's optional.
* Enter the local ip address and port (11041) in the companion mobile app to connect to the server.
* Once everything's connected correctly, you can simply start asking your AI assistant to do stuff! For example, try asking it to send a test notification to your phone.
